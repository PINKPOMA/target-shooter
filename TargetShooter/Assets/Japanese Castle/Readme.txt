Japanese Castle Pack

To line up the meshes reset the position or use integer numbers 
then move the pieces using the snap to grid (holding ctrl), 
use rotations of 90, 0, -90 or 180 degrees then duplicate and move again.

For better graphics results make sure that color space is set to Linear.
go to edit/ProjectSettings/PlayerSettings and in OtherSettings tab change the Color Space to Linear.

Thanks for purchasing my package
